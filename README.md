TestAssignment9

What we have done here is we have made a servlet page, that has the parameters of:
user,
username.

In jMeter we are also sending a checker for if the extra parameter form the excel file contains true or false.

Unfortunately the response error has to do with it not being a json object, which is something we have tried to fix alot
by playing with gson
