What we have done here is we have made a servlet page, that has the parameters of:
user,
username.

In jMeter we are also sending a checker for if the extra parameter form the excel file contains true or false.

Unfortunately the response error has to do with it not being a json object, which is something we have tried to fix alot
by playing with gson

to spare you the problem of trying to make the project work, we have put the project online at:
